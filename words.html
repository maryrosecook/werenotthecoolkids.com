			<h5>Blue Clamp [EP]</h5>

			<a name="crackerjackson"></a>
			<h5>Cracker Jackson</h5>
				<h2>
					Jackson, can I be your friend?<BR>
					We could BMX bike through life -<BR>
					The warm-dust, sun-down streets,<BR>
					The blue-brusied wife.<BR>
					<BR>
					Can I steal cars with you?<BR>
					'Cause I'm so happy I can't stand it.<BR>
					<BR>
					And I can't let it inside of me.<BR>
					It feels like there's too much.<BR>
				</h2>

			<a name="number34"></a>
			<h5>Number 34</h5>
				<h2>
					[This song is about a house I used to live in, 34 Broomhall Place.]
				</h2>
				<h2>
					I wake up to<BR>
					Delicious aches<BR>
					Of sunlit rooms<BR>
					That dissolve away.<BR>
					<BR>
					Hugs, cigarettes, essays, girls, Nintendo.<BR>
					<BR>
					I watch from the road.<BR>
					I can't come home.
				</h2>

			<a name="crafternoon"></a>
			<h5>Crafternoon</h5>
				<h2>
					[For Alice-Rose, the girl who invented the word 'crafternoon'.  Also the girl who has fallen off the radar.]
				</h2>
				<h2>
					I'll find the glue and you can bring some paper<BR>
					But I'll wait for you as it gets much later.<BR>
					So I'll get my guitar and write this song,<BR>
					But you're not here so you can't sing along.<BR>
					<BR>
					Could've made your Sigmund Freud hard deal chair.<BR>
					Might've made cardboard keyboards for my teddy-bears.<BR>
					We could've drunk tea and written this tune,<BR>
					But I've been waiting for you all afternoon.<BR>
					<BR>
					We could have gone out and done some stencils<BR>
					And I could've graffitied on hearts in pencil.<BR>
					But you would have said I was sentimental.
				</h2>

			<a name="ghosts"></a>
			<h5>Ghosts</h5>
				<h2>
					Slip through my ghost lips,<BR>
					Past childish hips<BR>
					To scarred-up slits.<BR>
					<BR>
					I should have died by now but<BR>
					For scalpel's healing cuts.<BR>
					So I float in the grey night<BR>
					Bearing a shadow that fades with the light.<BR>
					<BR>
					Shadow that I feel,<BR>
					Shadow that I see,<BR>
					Ghost calling mummy.
				</h2>

			<h5>I'm A Hungry Little Girl [EP]</h5>

			<a name="trope"></a>
			<h5>Trope</h5>
				<h2>
					I said XY<BR>
					Showed you my insides<BR>
					And you processed it by making some kind of dumb fucking joke<BR>
					<BR>
					Because I could hope<BR>
					And maybe just cope<BR>
					With my queerness but you took that with your distancing trope<BR>
					<BR>
					And I should have said goodbye<BR>
					And I should have taken my life<BR>
					<BR>
					But back in the fall<BR>
					When I told you all<BR>
					Then still my memory<BR>
					Is you accepting me<BR>
				</h2>

			<a name="clothesmaketheman"></a>
			<h5>Clothes Make The Man</h5>
				<h2>
					[This song is about the paradoxical relationship between three levels of appearance.
					The lowest, the unorthodox inside of the body; the middle, the orthodox outside of the body; the
					top, the orthodox clothes covering the body.  The unorthodox inside puts one beyond normal
					acceptance, the orthodox outside is a fake that covers the inside and the clothing is another
					cover, this time genuine, that puts one outside the community that would be the most accepting
					of the inside.]
				</h2>
				<h2>
					So I know that<BR>
					I don't seem like<BR>
					Other girls underneath my clothes<BR>
					I don't seem right<BR>
					<BR>
					But don't hesitate<BR>
					Touch like I'm not fake<BR>
					<BR>
					Look at me<BR>
					Reject me and my straight disguise<BR>
					But if<BR>
					You look close enough into my<BR>
					Eyes<BR>
					<BR>
					You'll see my<BR>
					Dress illusion<BR>
					Authenticates<BR>
					My confusion<BR>
					<BR>
					Because nothing fits
				</h2>

			<a name="endofasquatparty"></a>
			<h5>End Of A Squat Party</h5>
				<h2>
					I love the way the dusty sun falls on the boards<BR>
					We can hold them back a little longer<BR>
				</h2>

			<a name="imaliarandimonfirespringsteencover"></a>
			<h5>I'm A Liar And I'm On Fire [Springsteen cover]</h5>
			<h2>
				[The lyrics from the original Bruce Springsteen song, I'm On Fire, are unchanged
				but the melody and chord are quite different.  The latter are reproduced below
				so that you can play along at home.]
			</h2>
				<h2>
					(E) Hey little girl is your Daddy home?<BR>
					Did he go and leave you all (B) alone?<BR>
					(E) I got a bad desire<BR>
					<BR>
					(A) Oh (B) I'm a liar (E)<BR>
					(A) Oh (B) I'm on fire (E)<BR>
					<BR>
					(E) Tell me now baby is he good to you?<BR>
					Does he do to you the thing that I (B) do?<BR>
					(E) I can take you higher<BR>
					<BR>
					(A) Oh (B) I'm a liar (E)<BR>
					(A) Oh (B) I'm on fire (E)<BR>
				</h2>

			<a name="heat"></a>
			<h5>Heat</h5>
				<h2>
					[The spoken bits at the beginning and end of this song are quotes
					from Jim Caviezel in <A HREF='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120863/'>The Thin Red Line</a>
					and Robert De Niro in <A HREF='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113277/'>Heat</a>, respectively.]
				</h2>
				<h2>
					This is the happiest bit of this song<BR>
					Well it'll get much sadder before long<BR>
					<BR>
					I can take anything you dish out<BR>
					I'm twice the man you are<BR>
					<BR>
					Crepe paper flitting up to<BR>
					The air and burning as it flew<BR>
					<BR>
					I don't even know what I'm doing anymore<BR>
					All I know is there's no point in me going anywhere if it's alone<BR>
					Without you<BR>
					<BR>
					I wish you'd say<BR>
					That and not go away<BR>
				</h2>

			<a name="letsgetoutofhere"></a>
			<h5>Let's Get Out Of Here</h5>
				<h2>
					One day I'll run away<BR>
					Slip into the secret dawn and leave all that I can't say<BR>
					<BR>
					I'll scream through the rain<BR>
					And take a new name - what, I can't say<BR>
					(Great grey skies as I<BR>
					Start with a clean slate and rub away what I can't say)<BR>
					<BR>
					People might give chase<BR>
					Or not see I've gone<BR>
					But I'll keep my face<BR>
					Turned to the dazzling sun<BR>
				</h2>
			<BR>
			<h5>Polly, Susie And Mary [EP]</h5>

			<a name="betsybyers"></a>
			<h5>Betsy Byers</h5>
				<h2>
					I wish I<BR>
					Was the kid Benjy<BR>
					From The Eighteenth Emergency<BR>
					<BR>
					Betsy'd invent<BR>
					My story<BR>
					And I'd graffiti<BR>
					My own history<BR>
					And<BR>
					<BR>
					Benjy wrote stuff so people would know he'd been there<BR>
					I
				</h2>

			<a name="mymouthslowlyfillswithblood"></a>
			<h5>My Mouth Slowly Fills With Blood</h5>
				<h2>
					You change my heart beat<BR>
					So it's not my own<BR>
					<BR>
					You say to lay down<BR>
					And slide up my skirt<BR>
					I do as you say<BR>
					And ask, Will this hurt?
				</h2>

			<a name="bemybaby"></a>
			<h5>Be My Baby [Ronettes cover]</h5>
				<h2>
					That night we met I knew I<BR>
					Needed you so<BR>
					And if I had the chance I'd<BR>
					Never let you go<BR>
					<BR>
					So won't you say you love me?<BR>
					I'll make you so proud of me<BR>
					We'll make them turn their heads
					Every place we go<BR>
					<BR>
					So won't you please<BR>
					Be my little baby?<BR>
					Say you'll be my darling<BR>
					Be my baby now
				</h2>

			<a name="other"></a>
			<h5>Other</h5>
				<h2>
					Put a tick in the box that describes you<BR>
					But there isn't one for me the confused<BR>
					List all the valid groups like there's one that fits<BR>
					<BR>
					Don't ask me to define myself
				</h2>

			<a name="inthedark"></a>
			<h5>In The Dark</h5>
				<h2>
					They come quick<BR>
					Out the dark<BR>
					Sight unseen<BR>
					In cold arcs<BR>
					Down my cheek<BR>
					<BR>
					Don't know why<BR>
					Won't go away<BR>
					Maybe it's<BR>
					The pill I<BR>
					Took today<BR>
					<BR>
					I'll fight it<BR>
					I will strike out<BR>
					<BR>
					But tonight I'm back in bed alone in the dark
